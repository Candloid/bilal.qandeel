## GitHub Repos to Show
Here are a couple of `GitHub` repositories that I would like to show you in `Java` and `Python`.

### [auto_api](https://github.com/Candloid/auto_api)
This project was meant to automate the endpoint creation process in a generic way for `Python` classes. The functions in the class will be walked through and added as parameterizable endpoints in `Flask` with a nice `JSON` settings file for `Postman` ready for use to test.

### [QubeR](https://github.com/Candloid/QubeR)
This project is an `Android mobile` app that is developed on `Android Studio` with the help of a team. It takes 3 QR codes and blends them into a single one. Yes, you can just snap a single QubeR code and get 3 QR codes that are supposed to bundle different, yet close, varieties: say language, gender, color preference, ... Or, you can snap 3 QR codes and generate a single QubeR code that has the capability to obfuscate one or more layers with an access code if wanted. i.e. this a the next-level complex QR coding capability.

### [personalBudgetManager](https://github.com/Candloid/pbm)
This project is part of an educational effort for creating a GUI `Java` interface to interact with a `MySQL` database.

## Distinguished Projects
### [Keewatinohk Converter Station](https://www.hydro.mb.ca/corporate/facilities/converter_stations/#Keewatinohk)
This project was with Scheinder-Electric (SE) for the benefit of Manitoba Hydro, MB, Canada. The project is a multi-voltage converter station drawing the hydro power of the Nelson river and is a part of the power grid interconnection between the US and Canada.

My role was to deploy SE's proprietary `PACiS` system there.

### [Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority](http://septa.org/rebuilding/substation/morton.html)
This project was with Schneider-Electric (SE) for the benefit of Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), PA, USA. The project is a substation that serves the transportation power grid in Philadelphia, PA.

I was tasked to present a training session for SEPTA's staff on SE's proprietary PACiS system.

### [Information Technology & Communication Complex (ITCC)](https://www.albawani.net/project/itcc/)
This project was with Schnedier-Electric (SE) for the benefit of Al-Bawani, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The project is a mini IT city that should serve as a technology hub.

My mission in the project was to deploy multiple management systems to different functional buildings; `KNX` lighting control, in addition to Building-, Data-, Energy-, and Measurement Management Systems.
