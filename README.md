## Welcome!
Hello. I am [Bilal Qandeel](mailto:bilal.qandeel@gmail.com "Email me"); an [electrical engineering professional](#engineering) with an unresolved fixation for [information technology](#it).

<p align="centered">
  What side would like to see?
</p>

## IT

### Keywords
`Python` | `Java` | `VB` | `ASM` | `C++` | `JavaScript` | `GitHub` | `DockerHub` | `Jenkins` | `Confluence` | `JIRA` | `TestRail` | `JSON` | `XML`

### Competencies
- Graduate Diploma in Computer Science from Concordia University, 2019.
- Hands-on expereince in `Python`, `Java`, `MS VB`, and `ASM`.
- Hands-on experience in specialized engineering coding languages. *See [Engineering](#engineering)*.
-	Worked with MongoDB, MySQL, JSON, XML.
- Worked briefly on `C++` and `JavaScript`.
- Acquaint with industrial coding production tools `GitHub`, `Dockerhub`, `Jenkins`, `Confluence`, `JIRA`, and `TestRail`.

### `GitHub` Repos to Show
Here are a couple of `GitHub` repositories that I would like to show you in `Java` and `Python`.

#### [auto_api](https://github.com/Candloid/auto_api)
This project was meant to automate the endpoint creation process in a generic way for `Python` classes. The functions in the class will be walked through and added as parameterizable endpoints in `Flask` with a nice `JSON` settings file for `Postman` ready for use to test.

#### [QubeR](https://github.com/Candloid/QubeR)
This project is an `Android mobile` app that is developed on `Android Studio` with the help of a team. It takes 3 QR codes and blends them into a single one. Yes, you can just snap a single QubeR code and get 3 QR codes that are supposed to bundle different, yet close, varieties: say language, gender, color preference, ... Or, you can snap 3 QR codes and generate a single QubeR code that has the capability to obfuscate one or more layers with an access code if wanted. i.e. this a the next-level complex QR coding capability.

#### [personalBudgetManager](https://github.com/Candloid/pbm)
This project is part of an educational effort for creating a GUI `Java` interface to interact with a `MySQL` database.

### Projects:
#### [Keewatinohk Converter Station](https://www.hydro.mb.ca/corporate/facilities/converter_stations/#Keewatinohk)
This project was with Scheinder-Electric (SE) for the benefit of Manitoba Hydro, MB, Canada. The project is a multi-voltage converter station drawing the hydro power of the Nelson river and is a part of the power grid interconnection between the US and Canada.

I was tasked to deploy SE's proprietary PACiS system there.

#### [Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority](http://septa.org/rebuilding/substation/morton.html)
This project was with Schneider-Electric (SE) for the benefit of Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), PA, USA. The project is a substation that serves the transportation power grid in Philadelphia, PA.

I was tasked to present a training session for SEPTA's staff on SE's proprietary PACiS system.

#### [Information Technology & Communication Complex (ITCC)](https://www.albawani.net/project/itcc/)
This project was with Schnedier-Electric (SE) for the benefit of Al-Bawani, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The project is a mini IT city that should serve as a technology hub.

My task in the project was to deploy multiple management systems to different functional buildings; KNX lighting control, in addition to Building-, Data-, Energy-, and Measurement Management Systems.
