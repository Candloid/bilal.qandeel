### Coding languages
I find myself most comfortable coding using `Python` and `Java`. I also can code using `C++`, `VB` and other different languages to different extents too.

### Coding production tools
I have worked with `GitHub`, `Dockerhub`, `Jenkins`, and `K8S`.

### Highlights
Here is my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Candloid). A couple of repos that I like to show:
#### [auto_api](https://github.com/Candloid/auto_api)
This project was meant to automate the endpoint creation process in a generic way for `Python` classes. The functions in the class will be walked through and added as parameterizable endpoints in `Flask` with a nice JSON settings file for `Postman` ready for use to test.
#### [QubeR](https://github.com/Candloid/QubeR)
This project is an Android mobile app that is developed on Android Studio with the help of a team. It takes 3 QR codes and blends them into a single one. Yes, you can just snap a single QubeR code and get 3 QR codes that are supposed to bundle different, yet close, varieties: say language, gender, color preference, ... Or, you can snap 3 QR codes and generate a single QubeR code that has the capability to obfuscate one or more layers with an access code if wanted. i.e. this a the next-level complex QR coding capability.
#### [personalBudgetManager](https://github.com/Candloid/pbm)
This project is part of an educational effort for creating a GUI `Java` interface to interact with a MySQL database.
